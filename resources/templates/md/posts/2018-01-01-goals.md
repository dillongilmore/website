## Travel

This year I'd like to travel throughout Europe. In particular the
Germanic speaking countries and their major cities. I've made a
separate post on my travel plans this year.

## Moving

After my travel plans in Europe conclude, I hope to visit
Washington and find a decent place for permanent residency.
