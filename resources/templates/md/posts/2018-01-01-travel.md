I don't know much about Europe. I've attempted to learn German,
Swedish, French and Spanish. The hard part about learning
languages is if you don't have any use for them then you forget
the words.

A lot of what I do know about these cities and countries I find
from Wikipedia as well as news events. My particular interest
in Germanic Europe stems from news stories I've read, in the past,
concerning countries such as: Germany, Sweden, or Finland.
These countries are home to some of the smartest people in the world
and what comes from them is quite incredible.

## Routes

Unfortunately, Google Maps doesn't let you add many destinations
nor does it let you add any additional destinations when using
public transportation.

There's also a ferry from Sweden to Finland that Google Maps
doesn't seem to know about.
